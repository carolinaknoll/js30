### JS30: JavaScript 30 projects Challenge
:sparkles: JavaScript 30 projects challenge, this time flavored with Node.js and Vash templating engine.
****

[JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) is a challenge where you learn more about JavaScript by creating 30 different mini-projects.

This is my JS30 repository. Here I keep all of the project files and notes as I follow the course's project ideas.

Clone this repository, install the dependencies and run `npm run start` to view the working version of the projects.
